- Hi, I’m @Nathan-Matthews
- I work as a software engineer at Carrier where I tend to focus on the design of security methods for embedded systems. 
- This includes encryption methods, key management strategies, manufacturing methods for key storage, and cloud solutions using AWS.
- I have a lot of interest in learning about cryptography and cybersecurity. 
- I'm currently working through The Odin Project in my free time to gain a better understanding of web development.
